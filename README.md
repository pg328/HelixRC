# HelixRC

This is literally just a repository to get my Helix RC up and running on new machines. 

```if (you've tried Vim):
  try Helix //slightly more intuitive, has a few utility bits built in like 'surround' and code actions and jumping through diagnostics, has LSP, syn highlighting out of the box and I've only been using it 1 day
else:
  try Vim (vimtutor) && try Helix (hx --tutor)
```
